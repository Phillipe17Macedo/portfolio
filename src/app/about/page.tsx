            Since I embarked on my journey into the world of web programming in
            August 2022, I have been captivated by its endless possibilities.
            With each passing day, my passion for this field grows stronger, and
            I feel more inspired than ever.

          <p>
            Currently, my personal quest is to secure my first job in the
            industry. But that's not where my ambitions end. In the future, I
            have the idea of becoming a Tech Lead, a role that encompasses not
            only technical knowledge but also soft skills.

            To maintain a strong foundation in web programming, I always
            challenge myself and seek valuable learning opportunities. Armed
            with this knowledge and a desire for continuous improvement, I am
            excited to keep expanding my skills and taking on new challenges. I
            believe that with dedication, perseverance, and a continuous thirst
            for knowledge, I can achieve my goals in the world of programming.

          <ExperienceCard.Description>
            One notable course I completed was the Javascript course taught by
            Gustavo Guanabara, an experienced and renowned instructor in the
            field, known for his incredible teaching methodology. This course
            provided me with a comprehensive understanding of Javascript, which
            also covered programming logic, helping me develop dynamic and
            interactive websites.

            Another experience I had was the FullStack course at Imagine School,
            which greatly complemented my learning in both front-end and
            back-end development. During the course, I had the rewarding
            opportunity to act as a student monitor, where I was responsible for
            supporting the course students by answering their questions and
            guiding them through their difficulties. This experience
            significantly helped me build my communication, mentoring, and
            public speaking skills.
